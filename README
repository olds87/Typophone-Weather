This is a mod to the awesome Typophone 4 theme found here: http://angelman8.deviantart.com/art/Typophone-4-175481865

Changes I've made:

- Instead of loading 88:88 initially for the time and then updating it, I am loading the correct time automatically using javascript.

- Added jQuery and the simpleWeather plugin and styled it to include the current weather.

- Added animations on tapping the weather.  Will now display today's forecast and tomorrow's forecast, then slide back to current conditions.

To change your zipcode:

	1. Edit the zipcode in zip.txt /private/var/stash/Themes.XXXX/Typophone GMT (or Typophone 4)
		- zip is within an array of zips. If you only want one city, you can leave as array of just have one zip.
		  
		1 city: 
			zip.txt content as array
			[20814]
			zip.txt content as text
			20814
		5 cities:
			zip.txt must be an array
			[20814,20036,20854,90210,85719]
	
	2. Respring
