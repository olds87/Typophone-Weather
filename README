This is a mod to the awesome Typophone 4 theme found here: http://angelman8.deviantart.com/art/Typophone-4-175481865

Changes I've made:

- Instead of loading 88:88 initially for the time and then updating it, I am loading the correct time automatically using javascript.

- Added jQuery and the simpleWeather plugin and styled it to include the current weather.

- Added animations on tapping the weather.  Will now display today's forecast and tomorrow's forecast, then slide back to current conditions.

To change your zipcode:

	1. Edit the places object in weather.txt.  You can add objects or remove them.  A single object will disable the city selector and only display weather for that city.
	
	2. Respring
	
Format for weather.txt:

{ units : "f" , places : [ 
{ cityName: "Bethesda, MD" , zip: "USMD0034" }, 
{ cityName: "Washington, DC" , zip: "20036" } 
] }

Units can be f or c.

cityName is the text that will be displayed in the city selector.
zip can be US zip code or Weather station code.

You can find it by going here:

Use loc id value for zip.
